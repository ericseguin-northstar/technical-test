# Backend Developer Technical Test

## Problem Statement

This technical test aims to assess a candidate's ability to develop and maintain backend systems for data ingestion, processing, and presentation.

**Scenario:**

You need to ingest news feed data from files stored on a file system. These files are published regularly and follow a specific format (see `newsfeed_en_2024_08_13.txt`). The goal is to display this news data on a simple web page with basic filtering capabilities.

## Interview Outline

The interview will be divided into two phases:

**Phase 1: Discussion** (25min)

* The candidate will be presented with the problem statement and sample data.
* An open-ended discussion will follow


**Phase 2: Code Review and Improvement** (15min)

* The candidate will be provided with a code snippet (in `ingestion.py`) that performs basic file reading and data extraction.
